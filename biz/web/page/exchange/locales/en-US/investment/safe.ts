    "intro_2": 'Follow the three main security principles outlined below to mitigate some risks associated with holding, using, and trading cryptocurrencies.',
    "part": {
        "title_1": "1.1 Maintain Your Privacy",
        "content_1": "Thanks to the nature of the internet, information can propagate very quickly, and sometimes, in undesirable directions.",
        "content_2": "There are plenty of people with malicious intent employing nefarious tactics in an attempt to steal your cryptocurrencies. Most threats and attacks are typically broadly targeted and work as a net — trying to catch everyone gullible and distracted enough, but not necessarily targeting a specific individual. However, if you unintentionally make yourself a target by revealing sensitive information, more sophisticated and focused attacks are possible.",
        "content_3": "It is recommended: ",
        "content_4": "(a) To consider the risks of boasting about your successful trading rallies",
        "content_5": "(b) Not to share your previously used addresses",
        "content_6": "(c) To be careful mentioning your balances",
        "content_7": "(d) To avoid sharing information which is connected to your offline identity",
        "content_8": "(e) To use encrypted communication channels",
        "content_9": "Think long term. Those few satoshis on your addresses can be worth significantly more in the years to come. Or not. You may even get rid of your cryptocurrencies in the meantime. But does it matter? A potential attacker, distant relatives or just envious strangers and acquaintances may not get the memo in time.",
        "title_2": "1.2	 Protect Yourself",
        "content_10": "Users of both the traditional banking system and cryptocurrencies are often victims of similar scams and frauds. However, with cryptocurrencies, various factors are pushing the burden of responsibility on the shoulders of the end user — mainly an inherent lack of trust and immutability of processed transactions.",
        "content_11": "Banks, regarded as trusted entities, have total custodial control of your money. Banks are regulated, and they communicate with each other which makes it easier to prevent and fight against frauds. If you get victimized or make an honest mistake while transferring money from your bank account, you can usually ask for a chargeback. In cryptocurrencies, once the transactions are propagated to the network and confirmed, they are irreversible.",
        "content_12": "Be vigilant. Learn about common phishing tactics, find out what keyloggers are, and get to know common threats described in FAQ and Help Center of Hashkey Pro. Getting familiar with these dangers will help you keep your coins secure.",
        "content_13": "Using strong and unique passwords and enabling the 2FA protection for your online accounts should be the first step towards improving your general security.。",
        "content_14": "You should not forget about protecting yourself against yourself too because you are (probably) a human and people make errors. Making a typo while creating your backups, sending your tokens to a wrong address or simply making a wrong decision may compromise your security and cause a lot of inconveniences.",
        "content_15": "‘Measure twice, cut once’ is particularly important when it comes to using and protecting cryptocurrencies.",
        "title_3": "1.3	 Be Your Own Bank",
        "content_16": "To ensure availability of your coins and maximize your security, it is recommended to hold your private keys offline. Although exchanges are generally much safer than ever before, it is still recommended to keep substantial amounts on the exchange accounts only if you are an active trader. Furthermore, similar to money in a bank account, unless you own and have the exclusive access to your private keys, you cannot claim ownership of your coins and you are left with a promise.",
        "content_17": "For the first time in history, you have a chance to own a digital asset in the same way you own physical cash or a chunk of precious metal. Unlike these other forms of assets, you can back up your cryptocurrencies on a piece of paper and gain access to your possessions safely anywhere in the world.",
        "content_18": "Of course, holding and protecting these keys to your cryptocurrencies bring many perils, as indicated in the previous section. Luckily, there are tools ready to help you keep up with these challenges and allow you to reap the full benefits of these new technologies.",
        "content_19": "The types of cryptocurrency wallets designed to hold your private keys vary in their security, ease of use, number of use cases, and even availability. Consider your options and choose a type most fitting your needs.",
        "content_48": "Software and mobile phone wallets offer a wide variety of features and are usually very easy to use. The big disadvantage from the security perspective is that they are connected to very complex and often online environments such as your mobile phone or a computer. These factors open many opportunities for viruses and hackers to access your coins; therefore, inexperienced users should only use these for smaller amounts of cryptocurrencies.",
        "content_20": "Paper wallets, which hold your private keys written on a piece of paper (or engraved to a plate of metal) are often regarded as one of the safest ways to store private keys. They are, however, quite difficult to manage and usually only viable for one-time use.Hardware wallets are typically the best at balancing the ease of use and high level of security. These pocket-sized devices protect the private keys against malware and hackers by keeping them offline but will cost you between $70 to $200, and they require physical confirmation for most actions.",
        "content_21": "Remember, security is never absolute and finished. Take your time to update your knowledge base from time to time and check your potentially weak points on a regular basis.  ",
        "title_4": "1.4	 Virtual Currency Frauds",
        "content_22": "Investment in financial assets often involves risks, and high returns are usually accompanied with high risks. When someone promises you that you can obtain high returns from buying virtual assets (especially when there are fewer bids and participants in the market for this kind of virtual assets), or when you are given a sense of urgency to invest and you have no time to think, a higher degree of vigilance should be maintained.",
        "title_4_1": "1.4.1 Fake cryptocurrency exchange apps",
        "content_23": "The most well-known example of a fake cryptocurrency exchange app is probably the one of Poloniex. Prior to the launch of their official mobile trading app in July 2018, Google Play was already listing several fake Poloniex exchange apps, which were intentionally designed to be functional. Many users that downloaded those fraudulent apps had their Poloniex login credentials compromised, and their cryptocurrencies were stolen. Some apps even went a step further requesting the login credentials of users Gmail accounts. It is important to highlight that only accounts without two-factor authentication (2FA) were compromised.",

        "content_25": "(a) Check the exchange’s official website to verify if they indeed offer a mobile trading app. If so, use the link provided on their website.",
        "content_26": "(b) Read the reviews and ratings. Fraudulent apps often have many bad reviews with people complaining about getting scammed, so make sure to check them before you download. However, you should also be skeptical of apps that present perfect ratings and comments. Any legitimate app has its fair share of negative reviews.",
        "content_27": "(c) Check the app developer information. Look for whether a legitimate company, email address, and website are provided. You should also perform an online search on the information provided to see if they are really related to the official exchange.",
        "content_28": "(d) Check the number of downloads. The download count should also be considered. It is unlikely that a highly popular cryptocurrency exchange would have a small number of downloads.",
        "content_29": "(e) Activate 2FA on your accounts. Although not 100% secure, 2FA is much harder to bypass and can make a huge difference in protecting your funds, even if your login credentials are phished.",
        "title_4_2": "1.4.2	Fake cryptocurrency wallet apps",
        "content_30": "There are many different types of fake apps. One variation seeks to obtain personal information from users such as their wallet passwords and private keys.",
        "content_31":　"In some cases, fake apps provide previously generated public addresses to users. So they assume funds are to be deposited into these addresses. However, they do not gain access to the private keys and thus do not have access to any funds that are sent to them.",
        "content_32": "Such fake wallets have been created for popular cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Neo and, unfortunately, many users lost their funds. Here are some preventive steps that can be taken to avoid becoming a victim:",
        "content_33": "(a) The precautions highlighted in the exchange app segment above are equally applicable. However, an additional precaution you can take when dealing with wallet apps is to make sure brand new addresses are generated when you first open the app, and that you are in possession of the private keys (or mnemonic seeds). A legitimate wallet app allows you to export the private keys, but it is also important to ensure the generation of new key pairs is not compromised. So you should use a reputable software (preferably open source).",
        "content_34": "(b) Even if the app provides you a private key (or seed), you should verify whether the public addresses can be derived and accessed from them. For example, some Bitcoin wallets allow users to import their private keys or seeds to visualize the addresses and access the funds. To minimize the risks of keys and seeds being compromised, you may perform this on an air-gapped computer (disconnected from the internet).",
        "title_4_3": "1.4.3	 Cryptojacking apps",
        "content_35": "Cryptojacking has been a hot favorite amongst cybercriminals due to the low barriers to entry and low overheads required. Furthermore, it offers them the potential for long-term recurring income. Despite their lower processing power when compared to PCs, mobile devices are increasingly becoming a target of cryptojacking.",
        "content_36": "Apart from web-browser cryptojacking, cybercriminals are also developing programs that appear to be legitimate gaming, utility or educational apps. However, many of these apps are designed to secretly run crypto-mining scripts in the background.",
        "content_37": "There are also cryptojacking apps that are advertised as legitimate third-party miners, but the rewards are delivered to the app developer instead of the users.",
        "content_38": "Cryptojacking is incredibly harmful to your mobile devices as they degrade performance and accelerates wear and tear. Even worse, they could potentially act as Trojan horses for more nefarious malware. s",
        "content_39": "The following steps can be taken to guard against them.",
        "content_40": "(a)	Only download apps from official stores, such as Google Play. Pirated apps are not pre-scanned and are more likely to contain cryptojacking scripts.",
        "content_41": "(b)	Monitor your phone for excessive battery draining or overheating. Once detected, terminate apps that are causing this.",
        "content_42": "(c)	Keep your device and apps updated so that security vulnerabilities get patched.",
        "content_43": "(d)	Use a web browser that guards against cryptojacking or install reputable browser plug-ins, such as MinerBlock, NoCoin, and Adblock.",
        "content_44": "(e)	If possible, install mobile antivirus software and keep it updated.",
        "title_4_4": "1.4.4	Free giveaway and fake crypto-miner apps",
        "content_45": "These are apps that pretend to mine cryptocurrencies for their users but don’t actually do anything apart from displaying ads. They incentivize users to keep the apps open by reflecting an increase in the user’s rewards over time. Some apps even incentivize users to leave 5-star ratings in order to get rewards. Of course, none of these apps were actually mining, and their users never received any rewards.",
        "content_46": "To guard against this scam, understand that for the majority of cryptocurrencies, mining requires highly specialized hardware (ASICs), meaning it is not feasible to mine on a mobile device. Whatever amounts you mine would be trivial at best. Stay away from any such apps.",
        "title_5": "1.5	 Summary",
        "content_47": "Generally speaking, the risk of investing in virtual currencies is high, and there is no corresponding guarantee for investors' principal and profitability. Investors interested in investing in virtual currencies or in industries related to virtual assets must have a clear understanding of virtual currencies and make corresponding plans for various scenarios that may occur. In addition, experienced investors are also advised to make investments within the risk tolerance range."
